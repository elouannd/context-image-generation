# Context Image Generation 🍌

A SillyTavern extension that adds scene-image generation with character context and avatar references.

For provider routing, maintenance guidance, security boundaries, and a verification checklist, see [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

Provider availability and evidence status are tracked in [docs/PROVIDER_CATALOG.md](docs/PROVIDER_CATALOG.md). TokenReply is currently experimental.

> **Fork notice** — This is a fork of [elouannd/context-image-generation](https://github.com/elouannd/context-image-generation) by **Elouann**. It was forked to add **LinkAPI provider support** (routing image generation through LinkAPI's Gemini-compatible endpoint) without changing your active SillyTavern Chat Completion profile. All credit for the original extension goes to Elouann; the original is released into the public domain under The Unlicense.

## What's New in this Fork (v1.7.1)

- **Single avatar-reference toggle restored** - The character and persona avatars are once again enabled together with one **Use avatar references** setting. Existing split preferences migrate automatically: either prior setting enabled becomes the combined setting enabled.
- **Swipe regeneration retained** - The opt-in swipe-right regeneration control remains available.

## Provider adapters and recovery

- **LinkAPI** keeps its existing Gemini-compatible and OpenAI Images model routes behind provider adapters. This does not change your active SillyTavern Chat Completion profile.
- **TokenReply (Experimental)** provides the text-only `grok-imagine-image` profile. It sends a minimal request until a live compatibility test confirms TokenReply's supported image-size/resolution field and response format.
- **Manual LinkAPI recovery:** in LinkAPI's **Advanced** settings, **Use legacy LinkAPI routing** lets you deliberately retry using the pre-adapter request path. It is never automatic, so a failed normal request will not make an unrequested second paid generation.
## What's New in this Fork (v1.7.0)

- **Lighter gallery** - Gallery images are now stored as files (only paths are
  kept in settings), instead of full-resolution base64 embedded in
  `settings.json`. This dramatically shrinks the settings file and speeds up
  saves and startup. Existing base64 gallery items keep displaying; new ones use
  files. Inline chat images are unaffected (they already used files). Prompt text
  in the gallery is now safely escaped.

## What's New in this Fork (v1.6.0)

- **Regenerate on image swipe** (opt-in) - Swipe right past the last generated
  image on a message to create a fresh variation, without re-opening the panel.

## What's New in this Fork (v1.5.0)

- **ChatGPT image models** - Generate images with OpenAI `gpt-image` models
  (e.g. `gpt-image-2-c`) through your LinkAPI account. Text-prompt only
  (character/user descriptions are included; avatar image references are not
  supported for these models). Optional "Fetch models" button lists the
  `gpt-image*`/`dall-e*` models available on your key.

## What's New in this Fork (v1.4.0)

- **LinkAPI Provider** - Added LinkAPI as a provider option. Enter a LinkAPI key (used only for image generation) and requests are routed through `https://api.linkapi.ai` without touching your active Chat Completion proxy settings.

## What's New in v1.3.3

- **Auto Generate** - Automatically generate images when messages are received (Off, Bot messages, or All messages)

## What's New in v1.3.2

- **Thinking Level** - Control how much the model "thinks" before generating (Auto, Minimal, Low, Medium, High) — Flash 2 only
- **Google Search** - Let the model search the web for reference images and information before generating — Flash 2 only (may not work on OpenRouter)
- **Updated System Prompt** - Default prompt now mentions internet search capabilities

## What's New in v1.3.1

- **Expanded Image Sizes** - Added support for 512px to 4K resolutions for Nano Banana 2 (Flash)

## What's New in v1.3.0

- **Nano Banana 2 (Flash)** - Added `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` as a new model option

## What's New in v1.2

- **Provider Selection** - Choose between Google AI Studio or OpenRouter
- **4K Image Support** - Generate 4K images with Gemini 3 Pro
- **Dynamic Model List** - Models update automatically based on selected provider

## What's New in v1.1

- **Message Depth** - Include 1-10 previous messages as story context for better scene understanding
- **Previous Image Reference** - Use last generated image as style reference for consistency
- **File-Based Storage** - Images saved to files instead of base64 in chat logs

## Features

- **Message Generation Button** - Wand icon in the dropdown menu on each message to generate an image from that message's content
- **Character Context** - Automatically includes character and user descriptions in prompts
- **Avatar References** - Uses character and user avatars as visual references for consistent art
- **Slash Command** - `/proimagine <prompt>` for quick generation

## Requirements

> ⚠️ **Important:** A Paid Tier of AiStudio or OpenRouter credits is needed to generate pictures. Free version will not work.

- SillyTavern (latest staging branch)
- Google AI Studio API key OR OpenRouter API key configured in SillyTavern, OR a LinkAPI/TokenReply key entered in this extension's settings
- A Gemini model with image generation capability:
  - `Nano Banana 🍌` (Flash) - Faster, cheaper (~$0.04/image)
  - `Nano Banana 2 🍌` (Flash) - Gemini 3.1 Flash
  - `Nano Banana Pro 🍌` (Pro) - Higher quality, 4K support (~$0.14/image)
